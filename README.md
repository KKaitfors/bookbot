# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project

This is a simple python program that when given a book (or really any text file) sorts through the contents
and prints a report showing the total word count of the book as well as the individual character count
for each alphabetic character.

When running, in addition to providing the script name (main.py) you must also provide a path to a text file for the program to analyze.
(e.g. python3 main.py book/frankenstein.txt)
